You can run this program with:

When executed with no options, this program will print ‘OK’ if there are no lexycal/syntactic/semantic errors; otherwise, it will print the Error that was found.

When executed with the —-print option, it will print the Symbols’ Table, the Intermediary Code and the Warnings if there are no lexycal/syntactic/semantic errors;  otherwise, it will print the Error that was found.
